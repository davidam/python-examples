Basic pie chart
===============

Demo of a basic pie chart plus a few additional features.

In addition to the basic pie chart, this demo shows a few optional features:

    * slice labels
    * auto-labeling the percentage
    * offsetting a slice with "explode"
    * drop-shadow
    * custom start angle

Note about the custom start angle:

The default ``startangle`` is 0, which would start the "Frogs" slice on the
positive x-axis. This example sets ``startangle = 90`` such that everything is
rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees, and the frog slice starts on the
positive y-axis.
"""
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Pie chart, where the slices will be ordered and plotted counter-clockwise:
labels = 'Males', 'Females', 'Unknows'
males = input('Males: ')
females = input('Females: ')
unknows = input('Unknows: ')
sizes = [males, females, unknows]
explode = (0, 0, 0)  

fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.pie(sizes, explode=explode, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%',
        shadow=True, startangle=90)
ax1.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.

plt.show()
plt.savefig('pie.png')
