#In a way, you created a Bag-Of-Words model when you tried text
#classification or sentiment analysis. It basically means you take the
#available words in a text and keep count of how many times they
#appear. Hereâ€™s how to build such a model with NLTK:

from nltk.corpus import reuters
from collections import Counter
 
counts = Counter(reuters.words())
total_count = len(reuters.words())
 
# The most common 5 words are ...
print(counts.most_common(n=5))
# [(u'.', 94687), (u',', 72360), (u'the', 58251), (u'of', 35979), (u'to', 34035), (u'in', 26478), (u'said', 25224), (u'and', 25043), (u'a', 23492), (u'mln', 18037), (u'vs', 14120), (u'-', 13705), (u'for', 12785), (u'dlrs', 11730), (u"'", 11272), (u'The', 10968), (u'000', 10277), (u'1', 9977), (u's', 9298), (u'pct', 9093)]
 
# Compute the frequencies
for word in counts:
    counts[word] /= float(total_count)
 
# The frequencies should add up to 1
print(sum(counts.values()))  # 1.0
 
# import random
 
# # Generate 100 words of language
# text = []
 
# for _ in range(100):
#     r = random.random()
#     accumulator = .0
 
#     for word, freq in counts.iteritems():
#         accumulator += freq
 
#         if accumulator >= r:
#             text.append(word)
#             break
 
# print(' '.join(text))
